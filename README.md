# Retail-Store-Sales-Analytics-

Welcome to the analysis of a Retail Store using Microsoft Excel. This project aims to unravel intricate patterns, draw insights, gain deeper understanding of customer behavior as well as provide recommendations to 
improve sales. 
I utilized powerquery to clean and transform the data, pivot tables to analyze the data, after which I visualized the insights gotten from my analysis by creating a dashboard in Microsoft Excel.

# Data Dictionary
This dataset was gotten from Kaggle and contains 9 columns and 1000 rows.
1. Transaction ID: A unique identifier for each transaction, allowing tracking and reference.
2. Date: The date when the transaction occurred, providing insights into sales trends over time.
3. Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer, enabling customer-centric analysis.
4. Gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female), offering insights into gender-based purchasing patterns.
5. Age: The age of the customer, facilitating segmentation and exploration of age-related influences.
6. Product Category: The category of the purchased product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Beauty), helping understand product 
   preferences.
7. Quantity: The number of units of the product purchased, contributing to insights on purchase volumes.
8. Price per Unit: The price of one unit of the product, aiding in calculations related to total spending.
9. Total Amount: The total monetary value of the transaction, showcasing the financial impact of each purchase.

# Business Questions
After cleaning and transforming the data, I analyzed the data using pivot table in order to answer some business questions such as:
1. Which product category holds the highest appeal among customers?
2. Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?
3. How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?

I explored my data transformation and visualization skills using Microsoft Excel in the project. For a comprehensive overview of this project, including insights and recommendations, please check out the full project.
